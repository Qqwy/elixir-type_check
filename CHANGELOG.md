### Changelog
- 0.13.6 -
  - Support for Elixir v1.17.x:
    - Fix an oversight in the pre-expander now that there was a slight change to the Elixir AST format. Thank you, @skwerlman! (c.f. #190)
    - Fixing a bunch of compile-time warnings. Amongst them, a reordering of split function heads (Thank you, @ulfurinn! c.f. #191)
  - Fixing some documentation typos, Thank you, @kianmeng! (c.f. #179)
- 0.13.5 -
  - Support for Elixir v1.15.x. Thank you so much for your guidance and help, @josevalim!  (c.f. #185, #186)
    - This required turning off part of TypeCheck's self-usage ('dogfooding'). This change should be temporary and will be re-introduced in a future version (c.f. #187).
- 0.13.4 -
  - No code changes, but two small improvements to the documentation:
    - Changelog has been split off from the README file.
    - A link to Marten's ElixirConf EU 2022 talk about TypeCheck has been added.
- 0.13.3 -
  - Fixes:
    - Ensures that TypeCheck can be used in Erlang-style modules (that do not start with 'Elixir.') (c.f. #174).
- 0.13.2 -
  - Fixes:
    - Fixes issue when unions are used as type arguments in remote types. Than you very much, @dvic! (c.f. #164).

- 0.13.1 -
  - Fixes:
    - Fixes issues with aliases to remote types not being followed. (c.f. #160)
- 0.13.0 - 
  - Additions:
    - Support for maps with multiple optional atom keys. Thank you very much, @dvic! (c.f. #165)
  - Fixes:
    - Fixes 'Enumerable not implemented' crash when passing a struct to a type expecting a fixed map. (c.f. #161)
- 0.12.4 - 
  - Fixes:
    - Allow syntax `%{String.t() => any()}` as shorthand for `%{required(String.t()) => any()}`. (c.f. #152)
    - Situations in which the fully qualified name of a type defined in the current module were not picked up (`Example.t()` not being found inside specs in `Example`. even though `Example` defined a type called `t()`). (c.f. #154)
    - A problem with using types with type guards in other modules. (c.f. #147)
- 0.12.3 -
  - Fixes:
    - Compatibility problems with Elixir v1.14. (`Code.Identifier.inspect_as_key`, working with the AST of imported functions)  Thank you very much, @marcandre! (c.f. #150)
- 0.12.2 -
  - Fixes:
    - Compilation error in a new Phoenix 1.16 project. Thank you very much, @assimelha! (c.f. #114)
- 0.12.1 - 
  - Performance:
    - Significant reduction on generated code size of runtime type checks. This will speed up compilation roughly ~10-50%.
  - Fixes:
    - No longer use white ANSI color in exception formatting, ensuring messages of the DefaultFormatter are also visible on white backgrounds (Livebook, anyone? :D)
    - Skip OTP app lookup (used to fetch per OTP app compile-time configuration) if we're not compiled inside an OTP app (such as inside a Livebook).
    - Improve generator for `Regex.t()` to generate only correct regular expressions. Thank you very much, @skwerlman!(c.f. #133)
- 0.12.0 - 
  - Additions:
    - The default options used are now fetched from the application configuration. This means that you can configure a default for your app as well as for each of your dependencies(!) by adding `config :app_name, :type_check [...]` to your configuration file(s). (c.f. #61)
    - `TypeCheck.External` module, with functions to work with typespecs in modules outside of your control. Thank you very much, @orsinium! (c.f. #113)
      - `fetch_spec` to build a TypeCheck type from any function that has a `@spec`.
      - `fetch_type` to build a TypeCheck type from any `@type`.
      - `enforce_spec!` to wrap a call to any function that has a `@spec` with a runtime type-check on the input parameters and return value.
      - `apply` and `apply!` to wrap a call to any function with the function spec type that you give it.
    - `TypeCheck.Defstruct.defstruct!`, a way to combine `defstruct`, `@enforce_keys` and the creation of the struct's type, reducing boilerplate and the possibility of mistakes. (c.f. #118)
  - Fixes:
    - Long-standing issue where Dialyzer would sometimes complain in apps using TypeCheck is resolved. (c.f. #95)
    - Creation of the new `maybe_nonempty_list` type will no longer get stuck in an infinite loop on creation. (c.f. #120)
- 0.11.0 - 
  - Additions:
    - Support for fancier map syntaxes:
      - `%{required(key_type) => value_type}` Maps with a single kind of required key-value type.
      - `%{optional(key_type) => value_type}` Maps with a single kind of optional key-value type.
      - `%{:some => a(), :fixed => b(), :keys => c(), optional(atom()) => any()}` Maps with any number of fixed keys and a single optional key-value type.
      - TypeCheck now supports nearly all kinds of map types that see use. Archaic combinations of optional and required are not supported, but also not very useful types in practice.
      - Because of this, the inspection of the builtin type `map(key, value)` has been changed to look the same as an optional map. _This is a minor backwards-incompatible change._
    - Desugaring `%{}` has changed from 'any map' to 'the empty map' in line with Elixir's Typespecs. _This is a minor backwards-incompatible change._
    - Support for the builtin types `port()`, `reference()` and (based on these) `identifier()`.
    - Support for the builtin type `struct()`.
    - Support for the builtin type `timeout()`.
    - Support for the builtin type `nonempty_charlist()` and `maybe_improper_list` and (based on these) `iolist()` and `iodata()`.
    - Adding types depending on these builtins to the default type overrides. **We now support all modules of the full standard library!**
    - `TypeCheck.Credo.Check.Readability.Specs`: an opt-in alternative Credo check which will check whether all functions have either a `@spec!` or 'normal' `@spec`. (Fixes #102).
- 0.10.8 - 
  - Fixes:
    - Ensures that the `Inspect` protocol is properly implemented for sized bitstring types (c.f. #104). Thank you very much, @trarbr!
- 0.10.7 - 
  - Fixes:
    - Ensures fixed-maps are checked for superfluous keys (c.f. #96). Thank you very much, @spatrik!
- 0.10.6 - 
  - Fixes:
    - Fixes issue where Dialyzer would sometimes complain about the generated return-type checking code if the implementation of the function itself was trivial. (c.f. #85).
- 0.10.5 - 
  - Additions:
    - Support for the builtin types of the `System` module. Thank you, @paulswartz!
- 0.10.4 -
  - Fixes:
    - Fixes issue where sometimes results of specs returning a struct would remove some or all struct fields. (c.f. #78)
    - Related: Ensures that when a `@type!` containing a `%__MODULE__{}` is used before that module's `defstruct`, a clear CompileError is created (c.f. #83).
- 0.10.3 - 
  - Fixes:
    - Fixes issue when TypeCheck specs were used inside a defprotocol module or other modules where the normal `def`/`defp` macros are hidden/overridden.
- 0.10.2 - 
  - Fixes:
    - Fixes issue where FixedMaps would accept maps any maps (even those missing the required keys) sometimes. (c.f. #74)
- 0.10.1 - 
  - Fixes:
    - Swaps `Murmur` out for Erlang's builtin `:erlang.phash2/2` to generate data for function-types, allowing the removal of the optional dependency on the `:murmur` library.
- 0.10.0 -
  - Additions
    - Support for function-types (for typechecks as well as property-testing generators):
      - `(-> result_type)`
      - `(...-> result_type)`
      - `(param_type, param2_type -> result_type)`
  - Fixes:
    - Wrapping private functions no longer make the function public. (c.f. #64)
    - Wrapping macros now works correctly. (also related to #64)
    - Using `__MODULE__` inside a struct inside a type now expands correctly. (c.f. #66)
- 0.9.0 - 
  - Support for bitstring type syntax: `<<>>`, `<<_ :: size>>`, `<<_ :: _ * unit>>`, `<<_ :: size, _ :: _ * unit>>` (both as types and as generators)
- 0.8.2 - 
  - Fixed compiler warnings when optional dependency StreamData is not installed.
  - Fixed pretty-printing of typedoc of opaque types.
- 0.8.1 - 
  - Improved documentation with a page comparing TypeCheck with Elixir's plain typespecs. (Thank you very much, @baldwindavid )
  - Addition of missing override for the type `t Range.t/0`. (Thank you very much, @baldwindavid )
- 0.8.0 -
  - Fixes prettyprinting of `TypeCheck.Builtin.Range`.
  - Addition of `require TypeCheck.Type` to `use TypeCheck` so there no longer is a need to call this manually if you want to e.g. use `TypeCheck.Type.build/1`.
  - Pretty-printing of types and TypeError output in multiple colors.
  - Nicer indentation of errors.
  - named types are now printed in abbreviated fashion if they are repeated multiple times in an error message. This makes a nested error message much easier to read, especially for larger specs.
  - `[type]` no longer creates a `fixed_list(type)` but instead a `list(type)` (just as Elixir's own typespecs.)
  - Support for `[...]` and `[type, ...]`as alias for `nonempty_list()` and `nonempty_list(type)` respectively.
  - Remove support for list literals with multiple elements.
  - Improved documentation. Thank you, @0ourobor0s!
- 0.7.0 - Addition of the option `enable_runtime_checks`. When false, all runtime checks in the given module are completely disabled.
  - Adding `DateTime.t` to the default overrides, as it was still missing.
- 0.6.0 - Addition of `spectest` & 'default overrides' Elixir's standard library types:
  - Adding `TypeCheck.ExUnit`, with the function `spectest` to test function-specifications.
    - Possibility to use options `:except`, `:only`, `:initial_seed`.
    - Possibility to pass custom options to StreamData.
  - Adding `TypeCheck.DefaultOverrides` with many sub-modules containing checked typespecs for the types in Elixir's standard library (75% done).
    - Ensure that these types are correct also on older Elixir versions (1.9, 1.10, 1.11)
  - By default load these 'DefaultOverrides', but have the option to turn this behaviour off in `TypeCheck.Option`. 
  - Nice generators for `Enum.t`, `Collectable.t`, `String.t`.
  - Support for the builtin types:
    - `pid()`
    - `nonempty_list()`, `nonempty_list(type)`.
  - Allow `use TypeCheck` in IEx or other non-module contexts, to require `TypeCheck` and import `TypeCheck.Builtin` in the current scope (without importing/using the macros that only work at the module level.)
  - The introspection function `__type_check__/1` is now added to any module that contains a `use TypeCheck`.
  - Fixes the `Inspect` implementation of custom structs, by falling back to `Any`, which is more useful than attempting to use a customized implementation that would try to read the values in the struct and failing because the struct-type containing types in the fields.
  - Fixes conditional compilation warnings when optional dependency `:stream_data` was not included in your project.
- 0.5.0 - Stability improvements:
  - Adding `Typecheck.Option` `debug: true`, which will (at compile-time) print the checks that TypeCheck is generating.
  - Actually autogenerate a `@spec`, which did not yet happen before.
  - When writing `@autogen_typespec false`, no typespec is exported for the next `@type!`/`@opaque`/`@spec!` encountered in a module.
  - Code coverage increased to 85%
  - Bugfixes w.r.t. generating typespecs
  - Fixes compiler-warnings on unused named types when using a type guard. (c.f. #25)
  - Fixes any warnings that were triggered during the test suite before.
- 0.4.0 - Support for `impl(ProtocolName)` to accept any type implementing a particular protocol.
  - Also adds rudimentary support for overriding remote types.
  - Bugfix when inspecting `lazy( ...)`-types.
- 0.3.2 - Support for unquote fragments inside types and specs. (c.f. #39)
- 0.3.1 - Fixed link in the documentation.
- 0.3.0 - Improve DefaultFormatter output when used with long function- or type-signatures (c.f. #32). Also, bugfix for `Builtin.tuple/1`.
- 0.2.3 - Bugfix release: Ensure TypeCheck compiles on Elixir v1.11 (#30), Ensure StreamData truly is an optional dependency (#27).
- 0.2.2 - Support for literal strings should no longer break in Elixir's builtin typespecs.
- 0.2.1 - Improved parsing of types that have a type-guard at the root level. (c.f. #24), support for custom generators.
- 0.2.0 - Improved (and changed) API that works better with the Elixir formatter: Use `@type!`/`@spec!` instead, support named types in specs.
- 0.1.2 - Added missing `keyword` type to TypeCheck.Builtin (#20)
- 0.1.1 - Fixing some documentation typos
- 0.1.0 - Initial Release
