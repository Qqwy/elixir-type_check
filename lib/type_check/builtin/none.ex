defmodule TypeCheck.Builtin.None do
  @moduledoc """
  The 'none' type has no inhabitants.
  In other words, no value will typecheck against this type.

  This means that we always return a problem tuple with `:no_match` as reason in its check.

  It also means that the StreamData-generator will not generate any values;
  instead, it will filter away values that would have been produced by `none()`,
  meaning that if you attempt to use `none()` directly in a generator, you might get a `StreamData.FilterTooNarrowError`.
  However, it's still possible to combine it with other types like `:ok | :error | none()` and e.g. use the resulting generator of that.
